RNA-seq workflow for collating data and performing basic quality control checks using post alignmnent / quantification data

This workflow will use the The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data, a project supported by the Common Fund of the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and by NCI, NHGRI, NHLBI, NIDA, NIMH, and NINDS. The data used for the analyses described in this manuscript were obtained from: [insert, where appropriate] the GTEx Portal on 09 Sept 2020.
